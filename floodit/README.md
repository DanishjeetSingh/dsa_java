it looks like the graph of the flood funtion resembles the graph of O(n)
the time complexity is O(n), since the for loop takes O(n) time and,
converting the LinkedList to HashTable and ArrayList takes O(n) time each
however the lookups and access of HashTable and ArrayList is O(1).

Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
